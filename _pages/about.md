I am an assistant professor at Università degli Studi di Milano - Bicocca.
My main research activity is in the field of 3D robot perception, with special attention to point clouds registration, a problem for which I have developed a [benchmark](https://github.com/iralabdisco/point_clouds_registration_benchmark).

More recently, my research has focused on the use of informatics techniques for neuropsicology and neuroscience. I am co-investigator of the DriveWin project, which aims to investigate the effects of different types of non-invasive neurostimulation on attention while driving. Attention was assessed on a driving simulator and two age groups were compared.

I am a lecturer at the School of Law and at the Advanced Specialization School in Neuropsychology.
